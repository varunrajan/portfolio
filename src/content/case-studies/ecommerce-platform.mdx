## Overview

This project involved building a complete e-commerce platform from the ground up, with a focus on mobile-first design and performance. The platform needed to handle everything from product catalog to checkout.

## Architecture Decisions

We chose Next.js for its excellent SSR capabilities and performance optimizations. The GraphQL API provided flexibility for the frontend to request exactly the data needed, reducing payload sizes.

Key architectural decisions:

- **Next.js App Router** for optimal routing and code splitting
- **GraphQL** for flexible, efficient data fetching
- **PostgreSQL** for reliable data storage
- **Redis** for caching and session management
- **Stripe** for secure payment processing

## Mobile-First Approach

Since 60% of our target users shop on mobile, we prioritized mobile experience:

- Touch-friendly interface with large tap targets
- Optimized images with Next.js Image component
- Progressive Web App capabilities
- Offline support for browsing catalog

## Performance Optimization

Performance was critical for conversion rates. We achieved:

- Code splitting at route level
- Image optimization with WebP format
- GraphQL query batching and caching
- CDN for static assets
- Server-side rendering for initial page load

## Launch and Results

The platform launched successfully and exceeded all initial targets. The mobile-first approach paid off, with mobile users converting at rates comparable to desktop users. The performance optimizations ensured a smooth experience even during peak traffic periods.
