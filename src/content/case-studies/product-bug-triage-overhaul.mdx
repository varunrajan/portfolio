## 1. The Goal: Smooth Scaling on Bug Triage

As Teachable's first dedicated Product hire, I had the unique opportunity to shape the Product team and tech operations.
We consistently shipped quickly, but we lacked a reliable way to understand the health of our bug reporting and resolution process.
What I learned informally from peers in Engineering, Customer Care, and Product was basic, but instructive:
- "I can't get anyone to fix the bugs I care about"
- "I wish they would spend more time with customer inquiries before bringing problems to us that aren't actually bugs"
- "I didn't even know we were asked to fix that bug"

Turns out, we couldn't answer basic questions:
- How many bugs did we have?
- How many of them are valid?
- How long do they take to resolve?
- Where were things getting stuck?

Bug reports flowed into Customer Care (CC), then to Product Solutions (PS - a technical support team that vetted bugs), and then out to multiple engineering pods. However: ownership, prioritization, and timelines all lacked consistency. The result was friction between teams, unclear accountability, and complete lack of confidence in the current system.

**My Goal:** Treat Bug Triage

I launched an initiatve to close the loop on information gaps, and lobbied the VP of Product, CTO, and VP of Engineering to back me up as I rolled out new tooling, behaviors, and overall approach to keeping our bugs squashed, product healthy, and customers ... well, /not/ noticing anything was wrong.

## Research Phase

We started by conducting extensive user research with over 20 enterprise customers. Key findings included:

- Navigation was confusing, with users unable to find key features
- Inconsistent UI patterns made the platform feel unprofessional
- Onboarding took too long, with many users giving up
- Support tickets were primarily UX-related rather than technical issues

## Design System Creation

One of the first steps was creating a unified design system. This included:

- Color palette and typography scale
- Component library with 50+ reusable components
- Spacing and layout guidelines
- Interaction patterns and animations
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

The design system was documented in both Figma and Storybook, making it easy for all teams to adopt.

## Implementation

The redesign was implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core navigation and layout structure
2. **Phase 2**: Primary user workflows (dashboard, data management)
3. **Phase 3**: Secondary features and edge cases
4. **Phase 4**: Mobile responsive design

Each phase included user testing and iteration before moving to the next.

## Results

The redesign was a significant success, with measurable improvements across all key metrics. The design system has since been adopted by three additional product teams, creating consistency across the entire platform.
