## Overview

This project involved a comprehensive redesign of an enterprise SaaS platform that had grown organically over several years. The goal was to create a more intuitive, consistent, and scalable user experience.

## Research Phase

We started by conducting extensive user research with over 20 enterprise customers. Key findings included:

- Navigation was confusing, with users unable to find key features
- Inconsistent UI patterns made the platform feel unprofessional
- Onboarding took too long, with many users giving up
- Support tickets were primarily UX-related rather than technical issues

## Design System Creation

One of the first steps was creating a unified design system. This included:

- Color palette and typography scale
- Component library with 50+ reusable components
- Spacing and layout guidelines
- Interaction patterns and animations
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)

The design system was documented in both Figma and Storybook, making it easy for all teams to adopt.

## Implementation

The redesign was implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core navigation and layout structure
2. **Phase 2**: Primary user workflows (dashboard, data management)
3. **Phase 3**: Secondary features and edge cases
4. **Phase 4**: Mobile responsive design

Each phase included user testing and iteration before moving to the next.

## Results

The redesign was a significant success, with measurable improvements across all key metrics. The design system has since been adopted by three additional product teams, creating consistency across the entire platform.
