## WIP - Brief Overview

Below you'll learn where I found myself, and a diagram detailing one of the outputs from this project (the tooling and workflows that supported internal teams and customers).
Soon this page will lay out the decision intelligence we enabled, and how we eventually had to set our sights further upstream than the Career Services Organization.

More to come!

## The Problem: Bootcamp grads not getting hired and no visibility into why

Chegg Skills provided online programs to train students for entry-level software engineers, data analysts, UX designers, and more. Every program came with 6 months of dedicated career coaching upon graduation.
Moreover, each graduate was guaranteed a job within six months, as long as they met a baseline level of job search activity, or get their tuition refunded.

It was clear that graduates were having a rough time: the market was tumultuous, and there were murmurs across the career coaching team that many of their graduates were either unable or unwilling to conduct a respectable job search.

Despite coaches' heroic efforts to maintain high quality coaching with rapidly expanding roster of new jobseeking graduates, they had meager visibility into their students' day-to-day activities and overall progress.
This meant the organization was worried, wasn't sure why, and didn't know what to do about it.

I came on as a generalist hired gun: part Chief-of-Staff/part Product Manager, to start capturing what happened off-platform.
It was crucial that we find ways to best serve our graduates, get them hired, empower our coaches to facilitate that success, and remove a potentially high liability for the business.
