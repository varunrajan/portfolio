## Problem Overview: Bootcamp grads not getting hired and no visibility into why

### Context

Chegg Skills provided online programs to train students for entry-level software engineers, data analysts, UX designers, and more. Every program came with 6 months of dedicated career coaching upon graduation.
Moreover, each graduate was guaranteed a job within six months, as long as they met a baseline level of job search activity, or get their tuition refunded.

It was clear that graduates were having a rough time: the job market was tumultuous, and there were murmurs across the career coaching team that many of their graduates were either unable or unwilling to conduct a respectable job search.

Visibility for coaches depended on self-reported spreadsheets and manual check-ins, which didn't scale with rapid caseload growth.

### Resulting Chaos

The org couldn't tell **who needed help, who was gaming the system,** or **whether the guarantee itself put the business at risk**.

In other words: they couldn't distinguish between **bad luck, bad heavior, and bad systems**.

It was crucial that we find ways to best serve our graduates, get them hired, empower our coaches to facilitate that success, and remove a potentially high liability for the business.

I came on as a product-minded Chief-of-Staff to turn moral & financial risk into something the department could reason about.

And I set my sights on turning off-platform activity into *decision-grade signals*.

## The Output: Solutions Implemented, Decisions Enabled

Before diving into the process, here's what we did and how it helped:

**What Changed**
- Rolled out Huntr (post-build v. buy analysis) across our jobseeker population
  - Leveraged webhooks via Zapier to:
    - update CRM (Salesforce) for Careers org to determine population-level jobseeker status health
    - event-driven alerts for coaches to reach out for just-in-time interview prep
- Built separate data warehouse using event & entity data to build predictive hiring models
  - Worked with data engineering & scientists to understand leading indicators of successful vs. stagnant hires
  - Defined "heatlhy jobseeker" and compliance metrics
  - Pushed segmentation & hireability logic (different playbooks for different jobseekers)
  - Produced interactive Tableau visualizations

**What it enabled for the Careers Organization**
- Quick coach alerts to intervene ahead of meaningful events (screens & interviews)
- Reduced "invisible job search" states
- Consistent source of truth for the organization
  - Employer relations representatives could query and make more effective intros

**What it enabled for Executive Leadership**
- Shared language to analyze and predict jobseeker performance
- Built targets, cohort cuts, and attribution to understand what interventions were working
  - Defined baseline hired rate trajectory to forecast impact of operational improvements vs. experiments
- Funded program-level interventions for stagnant jobseekers
  - Based on quicker detection of stagnation at a cohort level
- Launched upstream course and program overhauls inspired by data-driven discoveries

### At a Glance: The System We Designed
After settling on Huntr as our tool of choice for the org and coordinating consent retreival process with Legal, I documented the workflows so the team could independently troubleshoot and make changes if the needs arose.

## Step 1: Define Our Surface Area

In short: where did we have agency and authority to make changes and measure what mattered?
I conducted interviews with relevant stakeholders and students to understand major pain points and how the org functioned as a whole:

- All career coaches
- Select Academic Success Managers: those who worked with students prior to graduation
- Leadership Teams
- Students
  -Current students
  - Struggling, actively job-seeking graduates
  - Recent successfully hired graduates
- Product, Engineering, Legal, and Data teams

My conversations yielded additional clarifying guardrails:

1. Coaches were overloaded with increasing load of jobseekers
    - This suggested little time to learn or wait long for new software or tooling
2. Software development was committed to marketing, admissions (sales), and education intiatives
    - Building new custom tooling would be expensive, sacrifice other company initiatives
    - This would also require lobbying, validating, designing new systems
3. Admissions Quality was a major unaddressable factor
    - The students who came into many of the programs were not well suited for employment in these fields
      - Chegg Skills as a whole was delaying investments in digital literacy training, or placing additional quality filters onto incoming students
    - For better or for worse: this was politically sensitive
      - There was meaningful resistance to suggestions being made too far upstream in the student experience
      - My mandate was to start within Career Services, and use our findings to validate
